# AdventOfCode
"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."

This repository contains my solutions and attempts for the puzzles in these challenges for the past two years.
